# AOD-Numerical-Lower-Bound
The numerical lower bound of the Ambulance Offload Delay problem.

In our notebook, we execute two examples. The first, a toy example, involves no penalties, zero time, and a single priority level. The second, a numerical example, incorporates all features and closely approximates the settings of our case study in St. Paul, Minnesota.
