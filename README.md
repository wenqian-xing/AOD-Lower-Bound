# AOD-Numerical-Lower-Bound
The numerical lower bound of the Ambulance Offload Delay problem.

In the provided code, we implement the lower bound using the information relaxation technique (Brown and Haugh, 2017). We provide two examples: the first, a toy example, involves no penalties, zero travel time, and a single priority level; the second, a more comprehensive example, incorporates dual penalties, travel time, and multiple priority levels.
